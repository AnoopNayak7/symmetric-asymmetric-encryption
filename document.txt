How It Works:
- Symmetric Encryption (AES-256-CBC):
    - The key and IV are generated using crypto.randomBytes().
    - Data is encrypted using crypto.createCipheriv() and decrypted using crypto.createDecipheriv().

- Asymmetric Encryption (RSA):
    - The RSA keys are generated using crypto.generateKeyPairSync().
    - Data is encrypted with the public key using crypto.publicEncrypt() and decrypted with the private key using crypto.privateDecrypt().
